# A2 Data Dive Detroit Restaurant Ratings and Violations
As a part of the 2019 A2 Data Dive, we compared Yelp ratings with health code violations of restaurants in Detroit to see if there is correlation between the two.

Null hypothesis: There is no correlation between the Yelp rating and the number of health code violations for a restaurant
Alternate hypothesis: There is correlation between the Yelp rating and the number of health code violations for a restaurant
